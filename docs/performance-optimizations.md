# Performance Optimizations for Chart Components

## Overview
Added `useMemo` hooks to optimize data processing in chart components, preventing unnecessary recalculations when components re-render with the same data.

## Optimized Components

### 1. AssetAllocationChart (`components/dashboard/asset-allocation-chart.tsx`)

#### Optimizations Added:
- **Allocation Calculation**: Memoized `calculateAssetAllocation()` to prevent recalculation on every render
- **Chart Data Preparation**: Memoized `prepareAssetAllocationChartData()` based on allocation data
- **Total Value Calculation**: Memoized the reduction operation for calculating total portfolio value

#### Benefits:
- Expensive allocation calculations only run when `assets` prop changes
- Chart data transformation only occurs when allocation data changes
- Total value summation is cached until allocation changes

### 2. ChannelDistributionChart (`components/dashboard/channel-distribution-chart.tsx`)

#### Optimizations Added:
- **Channel Breakdown**: Memoized `calculateChannelBreakdown()` to cache lead source analysis
- **Chart Data Preparation**: Memoized `prepareChannelDistributionChartData()` based on channel data
- **Total Leads Count**: Memoized the reduction for calculating total leads

#### Benefits:
- Channel analysis only recalculates when `leads` prop changes
- Chart formatting is cached based on channel breakdown
- Total count calculation is optimized

### 3. LeadsTrendChart (`components/dashboard/leads-trend-chart.tsx`)

#### Optimizations Added:
- **Trend Data Generation**: Already had memoization for `generateLeadTrendData()` based on leads and time period
- **Chart Data Preparation**: Added memoization for `prepareLeadTrendsChartData()` based on trend data

#### Benefits:
- Trend analysis recalculates only when leads or time period changes
- Chart data preparation is cached based on trend data
- Time period changes don't trigger full data reprocessing

## Performance Impact

### Before Optimization:
- Every re-render triggered full recalculation of:
  - Asset allocation analysis
  - Channel distribution breakdown
  - Trend data generation
  - Chart data preparation
  - Aggregate calculations (totals, sums, etc.)

### After Optimization:
- Calculations are memoized and only recompute when dependencies change
- React can skip expensive operations on re-renders with same props
- Reduced CPU usage during component updates
- Improved responsiveness, especially with large datasets

## Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Before
const allocation = calculateAssetAllocation(assets || [])
const chartData = prepareAssetAllocationChartData(allocation)

// After
const allocation = useMemo(
  () => calculateAssetAllocation(assets || []),
  [assets]
)

const chartData = useMemo(
  () => prepareAssetAllocationChartData(allocation),
  [allocation]
)
```

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Granular Memoization**: Each calculation step is memoized separately, allowing partial recalculation when needed
2. **Dependency Arrays**: Carefully specified dependencies ensure memoization works correctly
3. **Null Safety**: Default values (`|| []`) prevent errors with undefined data
4. **Cascading Dependencies**: Chart data depends on processed data, creating an efficient calculation chain

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Performance Testing**: Use React DevTools Profiler to measure render times before/after
2. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption with large datasets
3. **User Experience**: Test responsiveness during interactions (time period changes, data updates)
4. **Edge Cases**: Verify behavior with empty data, single items, and large datasets

## Future Optimizations

Consider implementing:
1. **React.memo()** for the chart components themselves to prevent re-renders
2. **useCallback()** for event handlers passed to child components
3. **Virtual scrolling** for legend items when dealing with many categories
4. **Web Workers** for very large dataset processing
5. **Lazy loading** for chart libraries to reduce initial bundle size
